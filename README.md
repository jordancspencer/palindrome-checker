# Palindrome Checker & Digit Frequency Mapper

This repository contains two Python functions focused on algorithmic problem-solving:

1. A function that checks if all words in an array are palindromes.
2. A function that maps digit frequencies in an integer using arithmetic and loops.

These mini challenges were completed as part of ongoing practice with Python and foundational programming concepts.
